# Getting Started with React App and API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependancies and Requirements

### `npm install`
If you have any problems with the dependencies, run this command to install all the dependencies

### `pip install flask`
If you have any problems with flask, run this command to install flask.

#### You MUST inform the team of any libraries used as we will have to install them on our own laptops.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Main Function:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### IMPORTANT: HOW TO EDIT FLASK API

When editing the flask api, if you want to test new functionality change the proxy to `"http://127.0.0.1:5000"`\
to allow fo connectivity to your local host. Once done inform Des\
so he can deploy it to the AWS cloud server and change the proxy back.\
Do not use the deployed api, there is no need, please always use the local\
api and let Des know if changes are made.
## Others: 

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
